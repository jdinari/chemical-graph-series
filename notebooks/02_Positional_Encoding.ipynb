    "1. ✅ Understand why standard GNNs struggle with positional information\n",
    "2. ✅ Compute Laplacian matrices from molecular graphs\n",
    "3. ✅ Extract spectral features using eigendecomposition\n",
    "4. ✅ Implement Random Walk Positional Encoding (RWPE)\n",
    "5. ✅ Compare different positional encoding strategies\n",
    "6. ✅ Visualise how positional encodings capture molecular structure\n",

    "**Why this matters**: Without positional encoding, GNNs can't distinguish between molecules with the same local connectivity but different global structure (e.g., isomers).\n"

    "**Today's challenge**: Standard node features are *local* (they describe individual atoms). We need *global* positional information so the model knows where each atom sits in the overall molecular structure.\n"
