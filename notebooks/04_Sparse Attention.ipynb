    "# 🧪 Lesson 04: Sparse Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "**Series**: Chemical Graph Machine Learning  \n",
    "**Prerequisites**: Lessons 01-03 (graphs, PE, GAT)  \n",
    "**Next Lesson**: [05 - Full Graph Transformer](./05_Full_Graph_Transformer.ipynb)  \n",
    "**Estimated Time**: 60-75 minutes\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will:\n",
    "1. ✅ Understand computational constraints of dense attention (O(n²) complexity)\n",
    "2. ✅ Implement sparse attention patterns on molecular graphs\n",
    "3. ✅ Use virtual edges to connect distant but chemically relevant atoms\n",
    "4. ✅ Balance local message passing with global context\n",
    "5. ✅ Compare sparse vs dense attention trade-offs\n",
    "6. ✅ Optimise for large molecular systems (proteins, polymers)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**: For molecules with >100 atoms, dense attention becomes prohibitively expensive. Sparse attention enables modeling at scale whilst preserving chemical relevance.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Quick Recap: The Attention Bottleneck\n",
    "\n",
    "**From Lesson 03**: GATs compute attention over direct neighbours (1-hop)\n",
    "- Efficient: only O(|E|) edges to consider\n",
    "- Limited: distant atoms can't communicate directly\n",
    "- Requires many layers for long-range interactions (→ oversmoothing)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Today's solution**: Carefully chosen sparse attention patterns that connect distant atoms whilst maintaining computational efficiency.\n",

    "---\n",
